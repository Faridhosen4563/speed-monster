                            The difference is that with sessionStorage , the data is persisted only until the window or
                            tab is closed. With localStorage , the data is persisted until the user manually clears the
                            browser cache or until your web app clears the data. SessionStorage is similar to
                            localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in
                            sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
                            particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that
                            particular tab

                            The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements
                            (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not
                            have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope. ES6 introduced block
                            scope by using the let and const keywords. <br>
                            <strong>The Global scope : </strong>A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a
                            variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global
                            scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including
                            inside blocks.<br>
                            <strong>The Block scope : </strong> A block scope is a piece of code inside a set of curly
                            braces {} and groups code statements together. Block scope use let and const.If you declare
                            inside block means inside function we can asses only this function, you cant call out side
                            of this function.

                            other hand global variable you can accesse any where.

                            JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing
                            the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is
                            quite different from models in other languages like C and Java. <br>
                            The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the
                            Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push
                            it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the
                            Event Loop.

                            <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the
                            collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
                            classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
                            transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables.
                            It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
                            <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
